Build a Flask API
=================

You want to build an API using Flask_, but you don't know where to start.
No problem! Follow the instructions in this repository, and you'll have an
API up and running in no time!

David Baumgold will give a `presentation at PyCon 2016`_ that walks through
the code in this repository. When that presentation is available on YouTube,
we'll link to it from this repository.
